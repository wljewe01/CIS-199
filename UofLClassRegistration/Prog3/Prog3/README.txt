 This application calculates the earliest registration date
 and time for an undergraduate student given their class standing
 and last name.
 Decisions based on UofL Summer/Fall 2018 Priority Registration Schedule

 Solution 3
 This solution keeps the first letter of the last name as a char
 and uses if/else logic for the times.
 It uses defined strings for the dates and times to make it easier
 to maintain.
 It only uses programming elements introduced in the text or
 in class.
 This solution takes advantage of the fact that there really are
 only two different time patterns used. One for juniors and seniors
 and one for sophomores and freshmen. The pattern for sophomores
 and freshmen is complicated by the fact the certain letter ranges
 get one date and other letter ranges get another date.
